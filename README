NOTE: for the USB variant, you will to enable "Software Mode Switching", which is disabled by default,
otherwise the Connector is not able to configure the device. You need to hold the touch switch for more
than 1.5s to force the device into configuration mode, then start the Connector, which will then set
(and persist) "Software Mode Switching".
